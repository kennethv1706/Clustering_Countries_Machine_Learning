## Introduction
The aim of this project is to find out which countries to visit based on the characteristics of each country

## Problem Statement
A friend came to me to ask for recommendations on which countries have low costs of living (residence, food, internet, etc.) because he felt that in the country he was living in, all the prices of necessities had risen so he planned to settle in another country and start his life as an immigrant.


## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle


## Data Loading
Load Data and clean the data


## Features Engineering
- Handling Outlier
- Scalling
- PCA

## Model Evalution
Define how many cluster that should be use to define countries' characteristic of each clustering using elbow method and silhouette score

## Model Definition and Model Training
Define Kmeans model to define cluter based on data of each country

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Do EDA to define characteristic of each clustering and define each country into which cluster

## Model Saving
Save the model

## Data Inferences
Make random data and deploy the model 

## Conclusion
### Characteristics of Each Cluster:
cluster 0: the country has the lowest figures in terms of everything, including cost of living, housing costs, internet prices

Cluster 1: the country that has the highest cost of living where we have to pay large costs for housing, large costs for necessities and high restaurant prices. This country is a developed country

cluster 2: countries that have various choices of internet packages because the population in these countries is large and almost all residents use the internet in their daily activities

cluster 3: a country that has a wide variety of prices because its population has varying income levels and the cost of living is the second highest compared to cluster 1, so varying prices are an option in that country
